    "'''1.Increase the size of the training dataset: Having more diverse examples can help the model generalize better. More data provides a broader range of patterns for the\n",

    "2.Use regularization techniques: Regularization adds a penalty term to the model's objective function, discouraging complex and over-reliant models. Two commonly used \n",

    "5.Apply early stopping: Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. Training is stopped when the model's performance on\n",
    "the validation set starts to degrade. This prevents the model from excessively fitting the training data and improves its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Implement dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks. It randomly deactivates a fraction of the neurons during training, forcing the \n",
