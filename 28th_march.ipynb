    "\"\"\"Ridge Regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a regression technique used to address the limitations of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It introduces a regularization term, based on the sum of squared coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter (λ), to the OLS cost function.\n",
